# Electron Assistant

Boilerplate of whisper.cpp + chatGPT + Electron.

Could be extended in many ways :
- add voice output with elevenlabs/Bark
- get text selection as input
- get file selection as input
- use OpenAI functions to execute "tools"
- save "memories" into Prisma db

e.g. : "convert this mov to wav please"

## Instructions

- Needs OPENAI_API_KEY env variable
- Expect many bugs and hacks
